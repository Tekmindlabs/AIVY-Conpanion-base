# Aivy Companion Base

## Overview
Aivy Companion Base is an AI-powered companion system that integrates advanced memory capabilities through the Mem0 Platform. This system is designed to provide personalized, context-aware interactions while maintaining persistent memory of user interactions and preferences.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- Advanced Memory Management
- Emotional Intelligence Processing
- Context-Aware Responses
- Scalable Architecture
- Real-time User Interaction
- Knowledge Graph Integration
- Personalization Features

### Memory System (Mem0 Integration)
- Long-term memory persistence
- Quick memory retrieval (< 50ms latency)
- Context-based memory search
- Memory relationship mapping
- User-specific memory storage
- Memory optimization and cleanup

## System Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (Latest LTS version)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Access to Mem0 Platform API
- Required API keys and credentials

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tekmindlabs/aivy-companion-base.git
cd aivy-companion-base
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. **Configure Environment**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
MEM0_API_KEY=your_api_key
ORGANIZATION_ID=your_org_id
PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

## Setup and Configuration

### Memory System Setup
```javascript
import { MemoryClient } from "mem0ai";

const memoryClient = new MemoryClient({
    organizationId: process.env.ORGANIZATION_ID,
    projectId: process.env.PROJECT_ID,
    apiKey: process.env.MEM0_API_KEY
});
```

### Basic Usage Example
```javascript
// Initialize the hybrid agent
const agent = createHybridAgent(model, memoryService);

// Process user input
const response = await agent.process({
    messages: [{
        role: "user",
        content: "Hello, I'm Alex!"
    }],
    userId: "user123",
    context: {
        role: "companion",
        personalPreferences: {
            interests: [],
            communicationStyle: "friendly"
        },
        relationshipDynamics: {
            trustLevel: "building",
            interactionHistory: []
        }
    }
});
```

## Key Components

### 1. Hybrid Agent
- Combines emotional intelligence with memory capabilities
- Processes user interactions
- Manages context and state
- Handles relationship dynamics

### 2. Memory Service
- Manages long-term memory storage
- Handles memory retrieval and search
- Optimizes memory storage
- Creates and maintains memory relationships

### 3. Emotional Processing
- Analyzes emotional context
- Maintains emotional state history
- Provides emotionally appropriate responses

## API Documentation

### Memory Operations
- Add memories
- Search memories
- Update memories
- Delete memories
- Batch operations
- History tracking

### User Management
- Create and manage users
- Track user interactions
- Manage user preferences
- Handle user-specific memories

## Development Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. Always handle errors appropriately
2. Implement memory cleanup routines
3. Maintain proper typing for TypeScript
4. Follow the emotional processing guidelines
5. Regular testing of memory operations

### Memory Optimization
- Implement regular memory consolidation
- Clean up outdated memories
- Maintain relevant relationship connections
- Monitor memory usage and performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Memory Service Connection
   - Verify API keys
   - Check network connectivity
   - Validate request format

2. Performance Issues
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Implement pagination
   - Optimize search queries

3. Type Errors
   - Ensure proper interface implementation
   - Validate data structures
   - Check compiler settings
